# Pensee Craft

Transform verbose or systematic content into compressed, memorable fragments (pensées) that deliver truth with maximum impact and respect for mystery.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**Refuse to:**
- Compress harmful content into memorable form
- Create pensées that mislead through false compression
- Sacrifice accuracy for elegance when the result would deceive
- Generate "wisdom" that is actually vapid or meaningless

**If asked to compress propaganda or manipulation:** Refuse. The pensée form serves truth, not persuasion divorced from truth.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to make an insight more memorable
- User asks "Compress this into a fragment" or "Write this as a pensée"
- Content is correct but forgettable due to length
- User explicitly requests Pascalian aphoristic transformation
- Communication needs to penetrate, not merely inform

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **content** | Yes | The idea, insight, or argument to compress |
| **audience** | No | Who will receive the pensée |
| **purpose** | No | What effect the fragment should produce |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Extract the Core Insight

Identify the single truth that must survive compression. Everything else is expendable.

**Questions:**
- What is the one thing that must be remembered?
- What would be lost if only this remained?
- What is the "heart" of this content?

### Step 2: 2. Find the Paradox or Tension

Pascal's pensées gain their power from holding contradictions:
- "Man is neither angel nor beast"
- "The heart has its reasons which reason knows not"
- "Man is a thinking reed"

**Search for:**
- Apparent contradictions that reveal deeper truth
- Tensions that resist easy resolution
- Reversals that surprise while illuminating

### Step 3: 3. Locate Concrete Images

Abstract ideas die; concrete images survive:
- Not "human fragility" but "a reed"
- Not "distraction from mortality" but "unable to sit in a room"
- Not "epistemic uncertainty" but "the eternal silence of infinite spaces"

**Transform:**
- Abstractions → physical objects
- Processes → specific moments
- Generalizations → particular instances

### Step 4: 4. Compress Ruthlessly

Apply the pensée constraints:
- **Maximum:** 3 sentences (prefer 1-2)
- **No qualifications:** Remove "perhaps," "sometimes," "often"
- **No explanations:** The fragment stands alone or falls
- **Personal pronouns:** "I," "we," "you" create urgency
- **Active voice:** Events happen; they are not described

### Step 5: 5. Test for Memorability

The pensée succeeds if:
- It could be quoted without context
- It creates a "that's exactly it" recognition
- It haunts—returns to mind unbidden
- It rewards re-reading with new depths

**If the fragment is forgettable, return to step 2.**

## Outputs

| Output | Format |
|--------|--------|
| **The Pensée** | 1-3 sentences, fragmentary, memorable |
| **Alternate versions** | 2-3 variations when multiple compressions are viable |

## Craft Elements

### Pascalian Techniques

| Technique | Example | Use When |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Antithesis** | "Not the God of philosophers, but of Abraham" | Contrasting false vs. true |
| **Rhetorical question** | "What do they know who are ignorant of everything?" | Provoking self-examination |
| **Hyperbole** | "All human evil from inability to sit still" | Emphasizing through excess |
| **Concrete universal** | "Cleopatra's nose" | Making abstract visible |
| **First-person confession** | "The eternal silence fills me with dread" | Creating intimacy |
| **Paradoxical reversal** | "Great because we know ourselves wretched" | Subverting expectation |

### Rhythm and Sound

Pascal's French has distinctive cadence. In English:
- Prefer balanced clauses: "Wretched to know wretchedness; great to know it"
- Use internal rhyme sparingly
- End strong—final words carry weight
- Vary sentence length to avoid monotony

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content has no single extractable insight | It may not be pensée-ready; suggest clarifying the core idea first |
| Compression loses accuracy | Return nuance; some truths require length |
| Result is clever but empty | Prioritize truth over elegance; restart |
| Multiple insights compete | Create multiple pensées or identify the dominant one |
| Audience needs explanation | Perhaps the pensée is for summary, with explanation following |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "People spend enormous amounts of energy pursuing status, wealth, entertainment, and constant activity, but when you ask them why, they often can't articulate a real reason. It seems like the pursuit itself has become the point, and if they ever achieved perfect rest with nothing to do, they would actually be miserable rather than satisfied."

**Output:**

### Primary Pensée
"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone."

### Alternate Versions
1. "We run from rest as if it were death—and we are right; in stillness, we would meet ourselves."

2. "The man who has everything still needs diversions. This is the diagnosis of our condition."

3. "Activity is not the cure for emptiness; it is the flight that proves we know we are empty."

## Integration

This skill is associated with the **Blaise Pascal** expert. When crafting pensées, channel Pascal's fragmentary method: truth compressed under pressure until it becomes diamond-hard and unmistakable.

*"Let no one say that I have said nothing new; the arrangement of the subject is new."*

The pensée does not explain—it illuminates. It does not argue—it shows. It does not persuade—it haunts.
